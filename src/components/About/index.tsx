            I am <strong>Koopa Querales</strong>, a singer-songwriter and guitarist from <strong>Venezuela</strong> living in <strong>Bruxelles</strong>!,
            I'm an '85s model, therefore I grew up watching MTV - Yes, I was the one watching world premiere music videos from Linkin Park, Blink-182 and Papa Roach.
            (I may or may not have listened to Britney and Backstreet Boys....)
          </p>

            My musical journey began in Venezuela in 2001, when I learned "Californication" from RHCP on the guitar. I made my way around, play at bars and clubs with different garage bands.
            <br />
            From there, I contintued to <strong>Argentina</strong>, <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>Belgium</strong>, where I started my solo career.
          </p>
          <p>
            My music is influenced by the '80s and early '00s rock.
            Although I'm a bit of a nerd, so I'm also a gamer and a <strong>software developer</strong>.
