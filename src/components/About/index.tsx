            I&apos;m a singer-songwriter and guitarist from Venezuela now living in Brussels.
            Born in &apos;85, I grew up with MTV, so I was right there when world premiere videos from Linkin Park, Blink-182, and Papa Roach hit the screen.
          </p>
          <p className='text-4xl'>
            My sound draws from &apos;80s and early &apos;00s rock, but I&apos;m also a bit of a nerdâ€”gaming and software development are big parts of my life too.
